#+title: Synology Drive

[[https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/drive][Synology Drive]] is a replacement of [[https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/CloudStationClient/DScloudclient?version=6][Cloud Station ShareSync]] and is more full featured.

I plan to migrate all of my files off of Dropbox to my NAS named Plato and then enable the [[id:1d7d18d4-c28a-4f49-8ef9-cd3fc46a915d][Synology Drive]] client on my computers. I'll also create a NAS user for jennifer and put
her files in her user directory and sync from the home laptop.
